                <p>After entering university, all students will face a lifelong decision, which is what major to choose
                    and what related
                    industry to pursue in the future. This choice will undoubtedly affect a person's life. The most
                    common saying we hear is
                    that we must choose what we love as our profession and the career we will pursue for the rest of our
                    lives. But I have a
                    different perspective, and I think this statement is not comprehensive. This major choice definitely
                    requires more
                    consideration, and we need to consider this issue from many different angles. Our love and passion
                    for a profession are
                    often the least important conditions to consider. I think we should choose what is most suitable for
                    ourselves as our
                    profession and career. There are many drawbacks to choosing a career based on our own preferences
                    and passions. Firstly,
                    in "5 Reasons Following Your Passion May Not Be The Best Career Move," Brian T. King mentioned that
                    following our
                    passions can often be disappointing when making a choice. In reality, there are more complex factors
                    that affect our
                    career, so we should focus on considering other factors. Although passion can enhance motivation, it
                    should not be the
                    sole determinant of career decisions. At the same time, in Finding Your Passion Is Terrible Advice,
                    Olga Khazan argues
                    that human passion is not innate, but can be cultivated. Therefore, even if we are not currently
                    interested in a
                    profession, perhaps in the future we can cultivate it and become passionate about our work. last,
                    Character Strengths:
                    Person Environment Fit and Relationships with Job and Life Satisfaction is also mentioned, A high
                    degree of consensus
                    between individual character strengths and their work environment significantly enhances job
                    satisfaction, reduces
                    burnouts, and contributes to overall life satisfaction. Therefore, in my opinion, when searching for
                    a career, we should
                    choose what suits us, rather than what we like. because people's passion for something is not
                    innate, it needs to be
                    cultivated, when making career decisions, we must consider the benefits that a sense of achievement
                    can bring. In sum,
                    Career decisions should prioritize suitability and long-term growth, as passion can be
                    cultivated and is not an innate determinant of success.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <p>Firstly, passion needs to be cultivated. People's passion for something is not innate, it needs to be
                    cultivated. Even
                    though we may not be interested in a profession right now, after a period of cultivation, we can
                    still be passionate
                    about it. If we simply believe that the career we like is the best and blindly choose the career we
                    like, it will make
                    our choices very limited, and it will be difficult for us to choose a career that truly suits us.
                    "The problem with
                    ‘find your passion’ is that it suggests that one’s calling is out there, Fully formed, and it's just
                    waiting to be
                    discovered. That's not how interests work. People develop passes by working hard at something.
                    "(Khazan, 2018) Olga
                    Khazan believes that passion is not something people are born with or need to discover. On the
                    contrary, interest is
                    cultivated through experience and effort. If we choose a career based on our interests, it will
                    limit us to the
                    preferences we already have and miss out on more and better career options. Therefore, waiting to
                    'find' one's passion
                    can create unrealistic expectations and genuine career development and fulfillment. We should
                    actively try more,
                    cultivate new passions, and find a career that is more suitable for ourselves.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <p>On the other hand, it is also important to acknowledge the value of passion when choosing a career.
                    When we choose a
                    career, our own preferences are certainly within our own considerations, but we should not consider
                    hobbies as the first
                    criterion for senior choices. In "5 Reasons Following Your Passion May Not Be The Best Career Move,"
                    (Brian T. 2019) the
                    author mentions "The most successful individuals often develop their passion through hard work and
                    persistence, It can
                    be seen that hobbies are only one of the secondary conditions we consider. We should develop our
                    passion in the field
                    that suits us, rather than letting existing passion limit our development. Meanwhile, Benjamin Todd,
                    in his TEDx talk
                    "To Find Work You Love, Don't Follow Your Passion," argues that passion can be developed by finding
                    meaningful work that
                    contributes to the well-being of others and aligns with our values. (Benjamin 2016) This method can
                    bring a deeper and
                    more sustainable passion beyond the initial interest. By contributing to larger causes, people often
                    find themselves
                    becoming more passionate and engaged in their work over time. Although passion should not be the
                    only factor in career
                    decisions, the value of passion cannot be denied. A possible counterargument would be that people
                    could develop
                    strengths in certain areas that they have passage for, desire struggling initially. However, without
                    a series of
                    advantages such as a sense of achievement as support, a failed career will be difficult for people
                    to sustain in an
                    industry for a long time.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <p>Finally, when making career decisions, we must consider the benefits that a sense of achievement can
                    bring. In her TED
                    Talk, "Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance," Angela Lee Duckworth emphasized that grit,
                    defined as persistence
                    and passion for long-term goals, is a major factor in success.( Angela 2013) In my opinion, the
                    reason why we become
                    passionate about something is that it combines our hobbies. On one hand, it can bring us a sense of
                    achievement and
                    greatly enhance our passion for doing something. For example, two people who had never studied
                    mathematics before, when
                    they first started learning mathematics, one of them could easily solve problems that were difficult
                    for others, while
                    the other person couldn't. It is obvious that the first person is more likely to develop a passion
                    for learning
                    mathematics. And this first person is obviously very suitable for learning mathematics. And this is
                    the benefit that
                    choosing a profession and career that suits oneself can bring. Choosing a career solely based on
                    current interests may
                    lead us to give up too easily when facing challenges, while choosing a career that matches our
                    strengths and cultivates
                    perseverance will enable us to develop in the long run. In real life, there are a large number of
                    people who choose
                    computer and business majors, because in the eyes of most people, these two majors will have more
                    ideal employment
                    prospects in the future. Don't all those who choose these majors have other majors that they love
                    more? Are people
                    working in these fields particularly fond of this profession? So it is obvious that most people do
                    not follow their own
                    preferences when facing decisions that determine their future. As we become more proficient and
                    confident in our
                    abilities, passion will grow over time, making courage and adaptability more important in career
                    choices than initial
                    interests.</p>
